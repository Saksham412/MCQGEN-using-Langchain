       " 'review': 'The complexity of the quiz is moderate, suitable for students studying Artificial Intelligence. The questions cover a range of topics within AI, from definitions to historical figures and advancements in technology. The language used is clear and concise, making it accessible to students at this level.\\n\\nHowever, there are a few areas that could be improved for better alignment with student abilities. For example, question 4 could be revised to include more concrete options related to AI research goals, rather than fantastical ideas like time travel or flying cars. Additionally, the tone of the quiz could be adjusted to be more engaging and interactive for students, perhaps by including real-world examples or practical applications of AI.\\n\\nOverall, with some minor adjustments to the quiz questions and tone, it can better cater to the cognitive and analytical abilities of Artificial Intelligence students.'}"
